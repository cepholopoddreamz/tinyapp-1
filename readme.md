bugs to fix:

weird error on urls page:// fixed

new error: too many url redirects - undefined console log, after a url is entered on the 'new' page. it should go to a url/:shortURL page... 

// this error had something to do with bootstrap *sigh*  // when the scripts for it were removed, the form action redirected to /urls correctly. will look up correct form tagging, maybe.
